Hey guys, this is my first post and I will be sharing a few things that I went through when making this.

## Parts that I struggled with

I had a couple of problems that I ran into that a bit of google could help me solve. Mainly with working GitKraken for the first time I was not sure how adding files and folders worked. I looked it up and they told me to just do it in the File Explorer on my computer and not through GitKraken.

- Installing Ruby
- Finding files in GitKraken
- Creating the drafts folder
- Moving the files from posts to drafts

## Parts that still don't make sense

I still can not make sense of how I search for files in GitKraken. Especially when all I see is just the timeline of commits on the "main" page. This time I just went to the saw that the file I needed was in the staged/unstaged section.

### What I am looking forward to

I look forward to using this as a way of documentation when doing things even outside of this course. Blogging seems like a thing of the past to me so I am pretty excited to use this often this year.

I might even document some non academic work aronnd my house on maybe a seperate page. I think it would be a cool thing to look forward to doing in my spare time.

### Links

I just need some links in this post in order to recieve full credit so here are those links:
