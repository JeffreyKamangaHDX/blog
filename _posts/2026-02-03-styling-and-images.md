Hey guys, this is my first reflection on some of the things that I did in Lab 3.

## What parts were new

The biggest part that was new to me was figuring out where and what I needed to change and how to access all of the information to make those changes. There were things like figuring out how to change the background image to "Razorback Red" and how to change the text color. Those things I only figured out after tracing all of the files that were being imported from the styles stylesheet.

## Parts that I struggled with

I really struggled with changing the date and author portion of my post and the links. I wanted to change their colors to white like most of the text that are on the page. This would have made the text a bit easier to read than the blue and grey constrasting with the specific (Razorback) red.


## Parts that still don't make sense

I still am confused on how to change the color of the links. I finally had one attempt where I was able to change the color of a link. However it changed just one out of the two links I had, and they were both formatted the same way. So I am still confused as to why that happened.

### What I am looking forward to

I am looking forward to learning new things with bootstrap and css to the point where I can make some really nice interactive pages. I think that will be something fun to look forward to.

### Links

These were 2 links I used. One was to get the pictures showing up on my page. And the next was a page documenting how to change the color of a link.
