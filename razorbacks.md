The Arkansas Razorbacks have put together a strong 2025–26 campaign so far, sitting at 16–6 overall and 6–3 in SEC play, placing them among the upper tier of the conference under second‑year head coach John Calipari. The Hogs have notched impressive wins over teams like Tennessee, Vanderbilt, and LSU, while their fast‑paced offense(averaging roughly 89 points per game) has been one of the most explosive in the nation. Standout freshman Darius Acuff Jr. has been a major driving force, while veterans like Trevon Brazile continue to anchor the frontcourt. Though the team has taken some bumps on the road, including losses at Georgia and Auburn, Arkansas remains firmly ranked in the national polls and in the hunt near the top of SEC standings as they push deeper into February.

Woo Pig!
