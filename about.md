My name is Jeffrey Kamanga. I was born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas and went to school at Little Rock Parkview Arts & Science Magnet High School. I am currently in my last year at Hendrix College as a computer science major.

If I did not come to Hendrix College I defintely would have been a razorback. I am a huge fan of anything UofA related which is why you might find links on/in my blogs. I love to play basketball, working out, and watching baseball. Woo Pig!

This is just a little bit about me and my life.
